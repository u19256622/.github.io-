Hailing from a middle class family of Bihar, I am Naresh Chukla. I am currently studying in class 10th. I feel glad to be the part of this great school with the such great friends, helpful and loving teachers and the sound school administration.  No one comes in this world at the stage where I am right now, without the support of family and friends. In fact, what I am today, is because of my family. My father is a reputable business man in our community. My mothers is a doctor. They both love their profession. Thatâ€™s I have learned from my parents. That is,  the value of time, sincerity, hard work and dedication to the purpose.  We are three brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most responsible from my brothers and sisters. I am in charge to guide and take care of my other siblings. We all study in the same school. Reading is my passion. I am an avid reader of Novels and history books. I have a keen interest in Indian History and classical architecture.  I love to read books that describe the rich history and civilization of ancient India. Apart from history, I love to read the novels of Shakespeare. Though I am rarely free from my routine works. But whenever I am free I love playing luddo game with my friends. I have been the top scorer in this game, in fact.
